### What: XDAG Funding System development

### Why
A funding system is a proven concept, people crowdfund all the time. Check sites such as GoFundMe or Kickstarter, and even other cryptocurrencies are crowdfunding work. My suggestion is that we can do the same. People can contribute to the proposals that attract them, other developers can get involved and propose their own ideas for a critical review of the community before it is formall accepted as an XDAG proposal.

This is the first proposal for the new system. 

### Who

My name is mathsw. Currently I am involved in the Dagger project where I mainly work on things for the website.

I have previously created websites, programmed various things such as games and wild-life simulations. My research includes working with Swedish government agencies and big Asian conglomerates.
